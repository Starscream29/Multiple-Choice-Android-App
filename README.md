# Multiple-Choice-Android-App
Android app that pulls questions and answers from a database to create a multiple-choice quiz. I created this to use whenever I found myself with a few extra minutes and nothing to do. HIST 115 is a very "remember the massive pile of content" kind of course, and writing and reviewing questions turned out to be great help. Now I have an app that can be used to easily quiz myself on whatever course this kind of review would be helpful for.

The database from which questions are drawn can be found in: app->src->main->assets->questionsAnswer.db

This file can be manipulated with standard SQLite to include and exclude whatever questions you prefer.
